The person who is happy always. He has every things of this world. \nWhatever we are doing all the time . All because of happiness. If in this case you are not always happy than there is something being  wrong with you. You must check it. Because it is matter of your own life. You must think about it. For it I have my own experience to be happy forever. It is gratitude. I believe that everyone is made by God and God does not make anything wrong. God always makes unique. If we are sad, depress, unhappy it is all because of our attitude\n      \n<img style=\"width:80%; display:block; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/df75f4f2c91921b096ca7a5f1b71843a_27277e4d9f/df75f4f2c91921b096ca7a5f1b71843a_27277e4d9f.jpg\" />\n    \nThere is golden statement about attitude is ( ## Your attitude is more important than your capacity) How much are you expert in your field. It does not matter in real life but how much are you strong by mindset it matters in real life\n              People have different different opinions of about happiness. Someone says that high income source is way of happiness, someone says. Loving and caring family is way of happiness, someone says. Luxurious life is way of happiness, For someone their love life.\nIn the same way each people have different different opinions about happiness but My experience says that. Real happiness lie in gratitude. \n         \n           Being positive, being kindness, being thankful for something or someone is gratitude. If someone helps you. Say to him thanks a lots. If not even than say to him thanks a lots. Now you are thinking if he helps me than it is right to say thank you but when he does not help than why I should say thank you. Because he try one's about you that's why. anyone helps  or not but don't be negative about him. After waking up say to God thank you God for giving me a new day, Thank you God for whatever you have given me, Thank you God for giving me loving and caring family, Thank you God for giving me best friends, Thank you God for giving me kindness society. If teacher has finished his class. Say to him thank you teacher for today's wonderful class. If wife cooked someone for you. Say to her thank you for cooking delicious food. If you ask something to any stranger. Say to him thank you providing me right knowledge. In same way whatever is in your life be grateful for this. One by one say thank you. Always be positive and kindness in life. If something is going to wrong in life. Don't warry. Don't be negative \nThank you to God. I will do it again. This time I will do it better than old time. If some precious thing broken like you car, your mobile, your favorite clothe your watch any thing Don't worry and incriminate to someone. Speak take it easy let's celebrate. Old one has gone new will come.\nIt will better than old one. I am very happy for this. This was making me angried but\nnew one will not. Be thankful, Be positive, Be kindness in your life, Be always grateful for Everything.\n                You apply this principle in your life. You will be always really really very happy. I am sharing it by my own experience you apply this. You will really get awesome results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You are scaring, being nervous and demotivated from inside while talking with people, clients, opposite genders, seniors and strangers. You are not only one who have this problem. Most of the people are suffering with this problem and most of them have overcome on this problem and rest of them are still suffering with this problem. I don't have any idea about rest of people who are still suffering this problem. They did not get right knowledge or didn't try once at least. But you are going to get right and straight knowledge right now. You try it once. Your talking confidently problem will be really short out and you will always talk confidently with anyone, anytime, anywhere. \n\n***Talk softly always with everyone***\n\n       We must always talk softly with everyone. I mean to say in natural tone. You do not have to cry loudly. I have seen some people. They don't not talk in nature tone. They talk loudly. I accept it. It is good for motivating someone but not good for talking someone. Four year ago when I was learning English language then I was also talking very loudly and fast. I was feeling very happy from inside that I speak one new language but when I begin to speak in real life then people begin to neglect me. Said that you are not good speaker then my mentor suggested me to softly\nIn natural tone\n          In this blog I am really going to give you five point to talk confidently in your life.\n\n## Knowledge\n                Knowledge is subject of your discussion\nRight and full knowledge gives us confidence to talk confidently. So first of all you have to get right and full knowledge on your subject then you have to discuss. There are many source of it. As example :- Book, Blog, YouTube, Subject expert etc. You can find all kind of knowledge from these source. Out of these YouTube and blog is really very cheap source. I always suggest everyone these cheap source. Who can not afford subject expert and book.\n\n## Perfect Practice\n         Knowledge is useless if you can not implement on this. Before discussion you must practice perfect on your topics. It makes your discussion easier and powerful. **Practice does not  makes things perfect it makes things permanent** (Shiv Khera). So practice always prefect. Perfect Practice is way to throw out mistake from inside of us. There is not any number of prefect practice. The more you can. You do it. The more you will the more your discussion will be easier and powerful. What do you think. After winning or losing championship by any players does he discontinue his practice. Not at all he knows. The more time he will practice perfect the more time something new improvement will come in himself so who you are, whatever your subject is but do not stop practicing perfect\n\n## Use your hands \n                Use your hands while talking with someone. Your words only teaches 20% but you hands 80% that what do you want to say. Your hands play a big your in your discussion and it does not let your listeners be unfocused.\n\n## Express gratitude\n                About gratitude I have discussed in details in last blog ( Real happiness lie in gratitude) l will explain it in one line being positive, being thankful, being kindness is gratitude. While talking with someone you express your gratitude. If he suggests you something say thank you for that, it he clear your some doubt say thank you for thank, if he uses some new life quotes then appreciate of his wonderful thought. Find way to express gratitude while talking.\n\n## Smile\n         Keep a beautiful smile on your leaps while talking.  It connected you with audience. It does not let him distract. It grows interest in himself for discussion. Smile clam your mind and body.\n(Human tend to mirror) In other words. If you will smile then your audience smile back without even thinking about it. When you stand up on the stage you smile first to connect you audience.\n\n           This was my five point to talk confidently with anyone, anywhere, anyhow. Use these points in your life and become confident.\n\n       <iframe width=\"932\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyv3qp3t18s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

You have everything excluding control of your life. You don't have any control on you life. For everything you are depend on someone. You unable to clearify what decision do you have to take.

To whom first of all you love and like after that everyone. Don't be one to whom first of all you don't love and like even everyone love. We don't have to lose yourself for gaining others. You are the hero of your story. If you will be not in your story than your story will be flap. \n\n     For being better person you have to bring small small improvement in yourself everyday.\nWe don't need to be like someone. We have to be the best version of ourselves. In this blog I have discussed most important quality. These quality must everyone have for become better person.\n\n## (1) Communication skill\n             It is most important skill for being better person in your life. In this skill everyone should be master. All of us usually communicate with native people but when matter comes about communicating with interviewer, senior, boss, enterpenor, businessman, officer, opposite gender we really unable to communicate well because we have still learnt it as language not as communication skill. Actually You will have to learn it is not so hard. There are some principal and rules which you will have to apply while communicating.\n\n## Discipline\n          Actually It is most important quality of human to developing new habit and skill. It is commonly applied to ragulating human and animal behavior to its society and environment it belongs. Discipline makes anything possible and easy for us.\n\n## Time management\n           If you know how to manage your time then you can save your life time. Everyone's has limited 24 hours. In this 24 hours you have to always do something different to be different. If once time goes then it never comes. Learn to manage youyour time that what all do have to do all day long, with whom you have live for making your time valuable. When you will learn how to manage your time and apply that then your value will be automatically increased.\n\n## Express gratitude\n              Express gratitude for every things whatever do you have. Being thankful, greatful for someone or something is gratitude. You must express gratitude to be a better person. You can express it with everyone like your servant's, driver, teachers, friends, family, strangers and neighbours etc if someone helped you without your permission so say thank you with beautiful smile I am greatful of your helping nature. If someone helped with your permission even then say thank you. It creates happiness in your mind.\n\n## Be what you love and like\n                  Be what you love and like not your family, friends, neighbours and relatives other wise all the life you will regrate on yourself that why did I follow their instructions. This is your life and you have to take decisions. Once you decide that become you future. \n\n           \n      \n\n\n",

You find that your time is not going for your priorties tasks. You have created several time wasterful habits. Who is making you hollow and weak from inside. You have still time. You can. Stop wasting your precious time on useless tasks and start focusing on your priorties tasks. If once time is gone then it is going to come again So do not waste it. Think about it how may it be precious. \n#### your value increase with value of your time.\n\n\n## Stop scrolling social media\n  Today we are passing our 10% time of a day on social media on the name of enjoyment. You are not enjoying on social media. It is enjoying with your life. It is making making money by your enjoyment. Today best place has been social media for passing time, for sharing feeling, for living alone and for sharing negativity. Social media is for sharing idea, thoughts and information so stop scrolling it \n\n## Talking and complening about others\nStop thinking about people and start thinking about yourself. If you will think about people than what people will think about you. You job is only to fly. You don't need to worry. How big is sky? Failure is stairs of success. When you begin to complening  others for your failure then the same stairs bring you down and when you learn from it then the same stairs bring you up. You are really going to get anything by talking and complening about others just you are wasting your time and energy nothing else\n\n## Learning a black skills\nLeaning a black skills are one the biggest time waster. Learning a skill which does not play big rule in your professional life is called black skill.\nLike - Dancing, Singing, Karate, Swimming, Any sports game etc. If any of them is life goal, dream or profession then you are investing otherwise you are wasting your time \n\n#### Learning a black skill is just like eating a junk food.\n\n\n## Fear\n  You have fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of yourself, fear of people what they will really think about you, fear of possibility, fear of family, fear of life, fear of future, fear of life partner, fear of relatives. Unless you are fearing until you can't do anything in your life. Let your mind think about your goal not fear. Stop fearing. Faith on yourself. You have ability to change anything into reality. You can make anything posible. You can.\n\n#### Fear = Forget everything and run fast\n\n\n## Unnecessary meeting\n  You waste your most valuable time in unnecessary meeting. Sometimes meeting with friends, sometimes meeting with strangers, sometimes meeting with relatives etc. When you meet someone unnecessarily. Not only you waste your time but also you feed your mind unnecessary massege. Stop wasting your time in unnecessary meeting. Meet to anyone when it is really necessary. \n\n#### Meeting with unnecessary people means wasting necessary time.\n\n\n## multi tasking\n     Common man used to do everything but entrepreneur never do everything. They do only important task which can not be done by anyone else but common man waste their whole day even than they unable to complete their task. Set it in your mind you are special person. God has made one piece on this planet. You do not have to waste your time in multi tasking. You are special and you have to only do specific task\n\n#### Multi taskers mean are not poor people. It mean small goal achievers. Specific taskers means big goad achievers.",

What all the reason, what all is difference between both ( Richer and Normal person ), What should a normal person really do to grow.\n\nThe major difference between normal person and  rich are their mindset. Normal person has one expectation One job. Which provides him high salary, holiday and security of their job for a lifetime nothing else. A rich man has expectation of varies income source. Which can provide him high profites , quality of time, name, stress free life, recognization, good health and many more. \n\nA normal person spends his most valuable free time of day on unless things like Gaming, Watching TV, Talking with people and neighbors, operating social media, watching movies and web series and doing unimportant task but a rich man doesn't have really free time to do all these useless task in their life. He has already set his goal of day what does he have do all day long.For entertainment he has fixed definite timeline.\n\n<img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/pexels_monstera_6289028_199857681c/pexels_monstera_6289028_199857681c.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nA normal person spends his money but rich man invests his money. A normal person spends $200 in drinks, $150 in shoes, $300 in clothes, $300 in eating out, $100 video gaming, $400 in music concern and many more but a rich man $300 in books, $300 in courses, $300 in stocks, $400 in business seminar, $100 in gm membership and many more \n\nA normal person saves money but a rich man invest. Normal person saves money after spending but rich invests his money before spending. It is major difference rich and normal person because of which rich is expanding himself by laps and bound. But Normal person still suffering under poority. Money does not grow by saving. It grows by investing.\n\nIf you become customer than you will always make  business rich,\nIf you become employee than you will always make your boss rich,\nIf you become debtor than here you will always make bank rich,\nIf you become self investor than you will always make yourself rich.\n  \nYou are writer of your life what you will write that will be always happen.\n\n\n\n",

It dis motivates us and force our brain to give up suddenly without knowing we are really on right path or wrong path. This thing has happened with varies people you are not only one. In this blog I am going to discuss about signs of growth.\nWhile chasing your dream or your any specific task. How will you really know that you growing. You are on right path.\n\n## Determination\n           In beganing often we generally fail again and again but we try again for that. It is really positive people habit that success does not come by discontinue something. It comes by trying continue after being fail. When you have  losed your everything after that if you are determined for your goal. It shows sign of growth in life. Your determination always matters before success and after success both.\n\n## Worry less do more \n          Positive and dreamers worry less and do more because They know that fear always prevails on hope. It makes them weak, dismotivates, unconfident and force you to think negative and Doer never be weak, dismotivate, and unconfident in life because they think less do more. Confident comes from when you feel good about yourself. You feel good about yourself when you accomplish you daily tasks. Stop yourself to worry and force yourself to do more.\n\n## Not to Blame\n       I have experienced in my life that the people who blames always something. For him everything is defficult and problem and the people who never blames. For him everything is easy and opportunity. Blamers spend their most valuable time in blaming. Blamers never able to thing big . Not to blaming is bigest sign of growth.\n\n## They don't give opinion on everything\n         Having an opinion on everything is just waste of time and energy. Nowadays most of the people have opinion on everything. Even he does not belong to that area. They have varies opinion.  Like > Why share price is decreasing. They will give you an opinion even they have never purchased a share. Why Ford company unable to stay in india. They have also an opinion about this. Even they don't know about auto mobile secrets. In my words these are useless fellows. If you don't have knowledge about something you don't have right to give opinions on anything.\n\n## Trying to impress everyone\n        Dreamers never even waste their time in impressing someone. They invest their time to impress themselves. People will never be happy. They will always procrastinate about you. You don't change yourself for them.\n\n## Willing to stop unproductive habit\n       Growth requires you to self awareness so that you can identify your shortcomings and change your unproductive habit. When you began to aware about yourself,about habit and willing to stop unproductive habit. It shows. You are growing. It is sign of growth. When you began to give up unproductive habits, time, people, tasks, thoughts, and plans and began to acquire productive habit, people, thoughts, tasks, time and plans then you began to grow.\n\n## Your definition of success\n       Time to time our definition keeps on changing about success. In beganing our definition os success was Money, luxury life style, Name, Identity on high level but after some time. It will be finished. These are rumor about success. The real definition of success is to finding yourself that who you are really. What is your real potential. How are you really unique. \n\n#### Success is depend on two thing (1) When you have losed your everything then your determination (2) When you have everything then your attitude. \n\n\n\n",

They attend extra class from out side. Even then they really unable to know their own potential and quality. After\nspending 25 year and more money in their education. In real life they unable to take decision. They ask to others. Why, do you want to know then read ahead.\n\n     Millions student complete their graduation every year with high grades but what is success percentage of them is in mynes. If their success percentage is in mynes then why does they do. \n\n           What does they learn in school and what they should learn. They learn in school how to work for money, how to fit in system, how kabiradas was born, how should do 9 to 5 job. \nWhat they really should learn for real life\n\n## (1) How to handle money \n              Unless you are working for money. Untill You can not leave your class ( standard ). When money began to work for you then your class change ( standard ) and school never teaches how to handle money.  School has taught you how to save money. Which does not grow with speed of inflation. Inflation increase every year almost 6% but your money which you have saved in bank only almost 4% per year. It means you are losing your money 2% every year by saving. \n\n## (2) How to start business\n                   After graduation and post graduation we have two options to work one for government and second for private and we choose one and work whole life. While knowing this is not my dream job and life goal. This is not going complete my all desire and dream even then we do. Because school has never taught you to risk. It has never taught you business lesson. About start up, selling, marketing, and funding.\n\n## (3) How to manage time\n             We invest our 7 hours in school per day till 25 year but that does not to teach you how to manage you time. If you don't know how to manage your time then you can never manage your life. Your productive, growth, talent, performance, idea, and many more is depend on your time management. If school did not taech you then please learn it from out side. It is really most important skill for everyone\n\n             Everyone has equals time 24 hours. Richest man of this world, best sports player of this world, a business man, athlete and a normal person also same 24 hours. In this same time someone has become richest man, someone has become best player, someone has become best athlete, someone has become best business man now you have to also be something in your life in this same 24 hours. And for this you will have to learn how to manage time.\n\n## (4) How to invest money\n                There are big lesson of interest in school book but unfortunately there is not any lesson of investment. Where should we invest our money, where should we invest our time and where should we invest our energy we really don't know. \"School has taught to save after spending but the right lesson is spend after investing not saving because saving decrease your money and investing increase your money.\" \n\n               For better future and security you should learn and invest your some capital. You can invest your money in matual fund where risk is 0%. You can invest in stocks, gold, property and in any business but for this you should have right knowledge. If you don't want to take risk and learn then mutual fund will be best option for you. It is better than your saving account.\n\n## (5) How to find your passion\n               If you make you passion you profession then you can do something new and big in your life. Unfortunately most of the people does not know what is their passion. They are just living life. They say that. Nobody taught him ever. How is find your passion.\n\n## (6) How to face failure\n                 Five year ago I was teaching English in an institute. There I realized that out of ten students only four five student able to learn. When I asked to them. Why don't you practice then they say that it is so difficult. I can't. I have been not made for this. The major problem is their education system did not teach them how to face failure. \n         Failure is stair of success. Don't worry if you fail. It shows that you have got on one stair of success. Here you are better than those who did not try at least once.\n\n## (7) How to communicate well\n                   There are two things in communication first is speaking effectively and second is hearing carefully but today not only student speaking effectively but also hearing carefully. This is problem of our education system. Here not only there is not full mistake of teacher but also mistake of our system and environment. This most valuable skill present time. You should be master in this skill.\n\n     There are many more skill like this. Which is most important for us. Like :  selling, making an impact, negotiating, personality devlopment, Thinking, public speaking and many more. Please don't depend on school and college try to by other side. Because I have never gone to school. I have only degrees and knowledge and others skill I have learnt by expert, online, failure and specialist teacher. You should also do. Do not depend on school only.\n\n\n                  \n              \n             \n ",

They create remarkable success and history very often. Winning is their habit. They are addicted to success. They are the extraordinary people. These kinds of people are operating whole world. They have power to make everything possible in life. They also inspire others. \n      \n\n\n",

      "content": " <img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/businessman_1492563_640_4d932ae126/businessman_1492563_640_4d932ae126.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n      Success, success and success all of us always wants but what is way, what is strategy, and what and how do we have to really work for this. We actually don't have an idea but don't worry I am with you and it is sure that if you are ready then every things is possible.\n                       In this post I am going to discuss about  six ultra powerful habit which will bring big changes in your personal and professional life. Just you have add these habits. \n                  \n### Some Facts about habits\n    ● Habits are a way for brain to save time and energy.\n● One keystone habit can change everything.\n● You spend you half of the time of day by automatic habit.\n● Habits are even hard to break than your thought.\n● You can take control of your life by changing your habits\n● Habits never truly disappear.They are just overpowered by other habits.\n● There are 3 loop of habits cue, routine, reward.\n   Cue > You are feeling.\n   Routine > You are drinking a glass of jise\n   Reward > You are feeling relaxed and happy.\n\n# Six ultra powerful habits \n## (1) Prioritize tasks\n             We always start our day with any work but it is not good habit because it is spoiling your time and energy. Here first of all you will have to prioritize your all tasks. You are boss of own life and your don't need to do all work. Boss has many employee for multiple tasks. He does only most important task of his company and others tasks get others to do that. Because if he will began to do then he will never able to achieve targets. In the same way you have to do only most important task of your life. \n                 You have to follow 80/20 principal. This principal suggest us to do only 20% tasks which produce 80% results not 80% task which only produce 20% results. By applying this principal you can save your sufficient time and energy and think about a new idea. Now you have to think and write that what is 20% task which will produce 80% result. This is first ultra powerful habit. Apply it. \n\n## (2) Money managment\n         A normal person spends his money but rich man invests his money. A normal person spends $200 in drinks, $150 in shoes, $300 in clothes, $300 in eating out, $100 video gaming, $400 in music concern and many more but a rich man $300 in books, $300 in courses, $300 in stocks, $400 in business seminar, $100 in gm membership and many more \n\nA normal person saves money but a rich man invest. Normal person saves money after spending but rich invests his money before spending. It is major difference rich and normal person because of which rich is expanding himself by laps and bound. But Normal person still suffering under poority. Money does not grow by saving. It grows by investing.\n\n## (3) Growing a network\n          You must have a solid network. Network multiply your time and work both. In 24 hours you can do one thousand, two thousand hours work only with the help of a solid network. Create your own network. Who is always ready to work for you. \n             You can do maximum 8 to 14 hours work very day but by network you can do lots of hours. Don't try do everything by yourself. Hire people for your different different person for your multiple tasks. Make yourself free to think for ahead.\n\n### Benefits of networks\n  ●  It helps you to make free.\n  ● You can make high source of income.\n  ● You can multiply you time.\n  ● Network makes works easy.\n  ● Network helps your start up.\n  \n## (4) Exercise and diet\n              Being healthy from inside and outside both is our first and most important priority of life. It should be your first goal.  Thirty minutes exercise and good diet not only makes you physicaly strong but also mentally strong. More than half of men and women are at a increased risk of multiple health problems caused by poor diet and exercise.\n\n## (5) Waking up early\n        Waking up early is one of the top successful people habit. Waking up early less likely to procrastinate, build discipline and get good and extra time exercise, more likely to get work done, build momentum for day ahead, get everyday extra 2 hours 14 hours week 728 hours or 30 days per year and don't get any insterruptions. \n\n## (6) Speed learning\n        Your speed of learning makes you different form others. Everyone has 24 hours as you have, everyone has technology as you have, everyone has almost same fecility as you have but your learning speed make everything different between you and your competitor. \n               These habits have to devlop for you growth and success in life. \n\n### Change your habits otherwise your habits will change you completely for whole life. After that you unable to change these habits with your all effort whole life. \n           \n\n\n\n\n        \n   \n\n",

Like : >  Waching movie on Netflix, overthinking, toxic friends, blaming, fake influencing, complaining and drinking alcohol. Which does not let us grow up and if somebody suggest something then we don't accept that and say. It should be in life for entertainment but It slowly - slowly infect your health, relationship, mindset, dream, as well as your creativity. You need to replace it with good habit. \n           \n      \" Good habits create you and bad habits finish you \"\n      \n## (1) Replace complaining with gratitude\n                                      An average people complain 15 to 20 time per day. Complaint is like rocking chair. It entertains. Complaint have multiple negative effects on people. Like : > it hurts your brain, it makes your relationship week, it decrease your and your brand value, it finishes your life possibility, \" it is a just addiction. \" Yoc can replace it with gratitude. Stop yourself from complaining and say thank you for everything what is going on in your life. Be be greatful for every small thing of life. If somebody hurts your then don't complain say thank you god that he shows his quality. He did not waste your much time. \n\n## (2) Replace overthinking with your actions \n                  Overthinking is simply thinking about something too much or too long for. Studies have cleared that it decreases creativity and increases stress level , make poor your decision making ability and it is energy - draining. Idea is not idea unless you don't take action. Think less act more. Because Nothing is going to be possible just only by thinking for possibilities you will have take massive action.\n\n## (3) Replace toxic friends with mentor\n                  In toxic friendship, you will never feel support and compassion. These kinds of friends are stigma in life. They never think positive about someone future. A good environment is most important for the sake of positive will power and good environment can be created by mentor, dreamer and positibe friend, family, successful people, knowledge and your inner world. \n\n## (4) Replace blaming with responsibility\n               Blaming is act of consuring or holding responsibility, making various negative statement about an individual or group of people ( excluding himself ). Blamers don't have ability to take responsibility in life. This kinds of people unable to get big responsible task. They consistantly work whole life as a labour. You must take responsibility in life for everything and never blame. \n\n## (5) Replace fake influencer with inspiring creator \n        I have experienced that who doesn't know ABCD he is teaching english. You can understand it. Today everywhere is influencer as well as they are free for advising even they are struggling in their life and they do not have hope for success. First of all you need to choose a right influence who can really guide you. Even if he is charging. You should learn from him because he has right knowledge, experience and expertise. Choose a right and expert inspiring creator.\n  \n    We can not delete our any habit but we can replace it replace you all bad habits with your good habit. Find out your all bad habit replace it with good habit. Success requires replacement.  \n\n            \n               \n\n\n",

      "content": "![pexels-andrea-piacquadio-842539.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/pexels_andrea_piacquadio_842539_8c81db7d67/pexels_andrea_piacquadio_842539_8c81db7d67.jpg)\n\nFirst of all you will have to simply identify yourself who you are right now and who you want to be in future. Your inner world is more important than your outer world. There are four kinds of people in this world (1) loser, (2) comforter, (3) averager, (4) unstoppable. Who you are right now it should really be clear to become extraordinary. Our some time is wasted between making a mistake and realizing it and more time are wasted between realizing it and exactly determining it. I want also. You don't waste your precious and valuable time between realizing and exactly determining that who are you right now.\n       Let's start the journey of being extraordinary.\n\n## (1) Do extra than your competitors and yesterday\n                     There are many people by your name in this magical world. You can search on social media or google. There are many people who has same skill what you have. Someone will be better than you, someone will be lower than you and someone will be like you. If you want to be number one then you will have to really do extra than yesterday. You will have to do extra than your competitors to become extraordinary. Because if you are also run in race with same speed. How fast your competitors are runing than you can not win. You will have to accelerate yourself for winning race. Do extra than your competitors and yesterday.\n\n## (2) Do the same but differently\n              Today who has become millionaire and billionaire, who has become best player, employee, manager, CEO, Owner of company, best coach, teacher, best sevies provider, best after or actress, winner and achiever. He has one common thing in his success that he had done same things but differently in life. Whatever you will be your goal no matter make strategy to achieve that differently. What Zeff bezos an American entrepreneur did. He opens a shop online started selling because he knew that online he increase and control his customer as much as he wants but offline no there is limit on everything. You can sell every product, every place, at your price, in every country, reach to every customer. But online everything is possible. \n\n## (3) Choose your words wisely\n                Your words is your reality. While speaking you need to choose your words wisely. Your dress is just like a cover. Your words are reality who you are really. If I have put you on a formal nice dress but your words are like illiterate or joker then my dress here is going to play any big role. If I have put you on normal and poor dress but your language is life educated and professional then here your dress does not matter. Your words are playing big role. It will never let you down in any situation. For choosing words wisely you must be good at in public speaking if you have not done it you should join soon this course. \n\n## (4) surround yourself with extraordinary people\n           If there is any common habit in extraordinary people is positive environment. They also reject negative environment. To make sure you are surrounded with extraordinary people. Make list of every  person with whom do you invest your 24 hours friend, family, coworker.  If those are not extraordinary then make again a list who can be. I will recommend you to read self- help book. It makes positivity surround yourself. It boost your brain power and increase creativity. \n\n## (5) You must consistently improve yourself\n            \n        There are four major areas of improvement to focus on: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual it is extremely difficult to improve all areas while ignoring any one area. If you don't care you health or body then you will not able to cultivate mental habits\n\n      Nobody and nothing can become perfect in his life but consistently improvement may you always be on the top. \n\n         Like all of us there are number of men in race of achievement. Our consistently improvement will make you extraordinary person. \nImprovement is a kind of invest whose return will be bigger than any other investment as well as it will be life long. \n       Consultantly improvement makes harder things easier. \n\n## (6) fill your day with high quality tasks\n             \n        Being Ordinary means little effort\nBeing extraordinary means enormous effort\n\n       Fill you day with high quality task e.g reading, taking care of health, managing task, measuring success, solving problem, over coming on fear. \nYou can not become extraordinary by watching TV, scrolling social media, spending time with ordinary people, doing unimportant task, having no goal, \n\n        You must have five year ahead plan that what all  do you have to do in five year, what all do you have to do in one year, what all do you have to do in six month, what all do you have to do in three month, what all do you have to do in one month, what all do you have to do one week and most important point what all do you have to do today.\n           \n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We try one time and two times but after it, if we do not get success, we give up very easily in this post I have shared all demotivating factors. Which demotivates you every time.\n\n\n1. Negative self-talk.\n2. Negative criticism.\n3. Public humiliation.\n4.  Lack of direction.\n5. No goals of personal and professional life.\n6. No discipline.\n7. Lack of right education.\n8. Unfair criticism.\n9. Fear of failure.\n10. Fear of rejection. \n11. Fear of people. \n12. rewarding the non-performers.\n13. Having no plan and strategy.\n14. Responsibility without authority. \n15. Unfair environment. \n16. Frequent changes. \n17. Unfair treatment. \n18. Low self-esteem. \n19. Lack of priorities. \n20. Unfair politics. \n21. Unfair education. \n22. Lack of measurable goal. \n23. Working on a desire, not on goal. \n24. Being a friend of non-dreamers. \n25. Thinking about always past.   \n\n We face this problem because of ourselves. We can confidently and easily fight with an outside problem but never ever with an inside problem. We are not still ready to take responsibility. We always blame someone or something for our problems and failure. We are continuously working outside not inside. **Learn to grow not to show**. Do not run after a score, number, degree for showing. This is important at times. It is not everything for your success. These are outside values that you can show but with them, you can never fight with an inside problem. You need to develop this quality to fight your inside problem. \n\n1. Accept responsibility\n2. Caring attitude\n3. Positive attitude\n4.  Listening\n5. Reading\n6. Self-study\n7. Presetting something\n8. Planning\n9. Making a goal\n10. Focusing  \n11. Time management \n12. Work management  \n13. Thinking positive  \n14. Communicating  \n15. Teaching \n16. Personality development  \n17. Problem-solving skill \n             \n**All fights of life you can never win with the help of body you will have to train your brain for it.**\n",

      "content": "![communication_skill.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/communication_skill_50b06703cc/communication_skill_50b06703cc.webp)\n\n People have a common bigger problem that is they have completely loosed themselves. They don’t know about themselves if they must explain about someone, they have plenty of words as well as can easily explain about his past, present, and future but when they must explain about himself, they have only a few words. I am X and I must be X1 but there are many for that I don’t think that I could be X1. They are often in confusion. They are often scared and ask senior or already successful people, what I should really do. In this post, you are going to learn how to find yourself. What should you really do and be in life as well as how could you really explain and expand yourself in real life? \n\n\n### Here is the most important question you need to ask yourself.\n\tWhile talking offline or online about whom or what do you talk most?\n\tWhat do you think most of the time?\n\tWhat is your own opinion about yourself?\n\tDuring the problem what do you generally think and do?\n\tAfter solving the problem what do you especially feel?\nAnswer all questions thoughtfully.\n### [1] Know yourself first \nIt is the right time to know yourself. Don’t worry, neither you are too late nor ahead. Every time is perfect to know yourself. It does not matter you are 20-, 30-, 50- or 80-year-old.  Age is just a number for success. “Age does not decide success” You need to confidently ask yourself. “Who am I really” How do people know me, what roles do I exactly play in others' life, what am I continuously doing. It was really my goal in life. If not, then why am I continue doing it. Before a few years ago I had also lost myself. I was hardly working on undefine project. Which was not my goal. I lost my three years of life. When did I ask this same question to myself then I realize? I should suddenly give up and continue with my real goal. What am I really want to do? For what I have born. It is your time to ask yourself. What do you have to do and what do you have to suddenly give up? Find out real-life goals, dreams, destinations, and purposes of life.\n\n### [2] Plan\nPlan your future, plan your five years, plan your one year, plan your six months, plan your three months, plan your one month, plan your one week, plan your one day, plan your, one hour, plan your one minute, plan your one second. You should have planned every second of life. How do you have to live life? \n                       No Plan = No Command on life\n### [3] Write down the obstacle \nWrite down the obstacle of today, tomorrow, and the future and think about them. How could you solve it? It could be like\n\tNegative self-talk\n\tNegative attitude\n\tLow belief \n\tFear of failure\n\tFear of rejection\n\tFear of what people will say\n\tFuture security\n\tLack of Time \n\tLack of money\n\tLack of support\n\tNegative People\n\tFear of losing\n\tFear of family\n\nDefine your all obstacle of goal and think heartily. What could be the solution to this obstacle? Solve your obstacle before a definite time. \n\n### [4] Action \nWithout action, every best plan is the worst. With action, every bad plan gives a good result. There should be no show-off, arrogance, greed, negativity, cheating, and jealousy in your action. Your action should be positive and helpful. Negative attitudes generate negative results and positive attitudes generate positive results in life. By negativity the more you do not hurt others the more the hurt yourself in life.\n\n No action = No result.\nAverage action = Average result.\nUnstoppable action = Unstoppable result. \n \t\n#### Looser always makes excuses and hardworking man always acts whole life \n\n\n First, you must know yourself ‘who are you really what is your real-life goal, dream, and destination and after it, you must plan for your goal. How could you easily achieve it? You should have a strong strategy for your goal again you have to find out all obstacles of your and then You need to act. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "How to create a plan for our works? It could be a major problem for most people's lives. I imagine that you are one of them. But don’t worry now you are at the right place. It is going to solve. A few years ago, I was also facing this problem. I was waking up early in the morning, but I had an uncleared plan of day in my brain. What do I have to do first, what do I have to do in mid and what do I have to do in last? In between, I had some home tasks. With an uncleared plan, I was starting my day and in the last, I was getting nothing excluding waste of time. Then I read the book “Goal “written by Brian Tracy Canadian motivational speaker after reading this book I realized where my all-time is going without a plan for my day. Now I don’t want to. It should also happen to you.\n\n###  Time waster activity of life \nThere are some activities in our life which are generally and complete waste of time, and we are continually wasting by this activity. We will have to understand soon and stop it to utilize our time at the right place and by the right activity. These time wasters are\n#### scrolling or operating mobile without purpose. \n#### Just for fun creating a negating environment \n#### Gossiping \n#### Watching TV\n#### Holding on to past \n#### Poor health habit\n#### Trying to please everyone \n#### Repeating the same mistake \n#### Spending much time on social media\n#### Thinking much \n#### trying to do everything \n#### Unprioritized yourself\nAfter reading this. Did you realize which poor activity you have developed to waste your time? If you have realized, then replace this poor habit with a new habit. Like, operate mobile with purpose when do have to learn something. Think less do more. Try to learn your own and someone's mistakes and make it right the second time. Past has been passed. We don’t have control over it, but We can control our future is completely in our hands. By prioritizing tasks, we can get a high result in less time. We don’t need to do bigger things for a better life. Just we need to focus on our habits. \n\n###  No plan in life = No command in life\n### Plan in life = Command in life\n\n## Identify works\nTake one page and paper list all tasks which you have to do. By doing this you can guess how much time do you need to complete one year, six months, three months, one month, one week, one day, or one hour. When you know how much time you need then you know well. How fast do you need to do your work? List down your work with time and date. \n![turn-on-2925962_1280.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/turn_on_2925962_1280_be6dcc54f2/turn_on_2925962_1280_be6dcc54f2.jpg)\n\n## prioritize your work\nWhat all work you have written on paper. Now you have to prioritize what you have to do first, what do have to do in mid, and what do you have to do in last. What works is giving 80 to 90% results you need to do that first. What works is giving 50 to 60% results you need to do in mid. What works is giving 20% result you need to do in last. And if you are starting to do any work then this strategy is not going to give you high results. Because when you write your works with time and date then it is not 100% confirmed that you can complete your all task on the exact time and date. \n\n## Identify obstacles\nNo plan ever goes off without a hitch. You need to identify potential obstacles that could prevent you from success. Write down those obstacles and think about that carefully how could you solve it\n\n",

Time is not going to stay for anyone or anything. You will have to suddenly take the right decision what do have to do right now? How could I make my time valuable? \n\n If you think that you have sufficient time then calculate it. How much time do have in a year, in a month, in a week, and in a day as well as how could you make your free time valuable? \n![training-396524_1280 (1).jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/training_396524_1280_1_dedeec723a/training_396524_1280_1_dedeec723a.jpg)\n\nWe have 24 hours to say but the reality is completely different. There are 24 hours in a day, but 60% of the time is only in our control and 40% of the time is out of our control whole life. Our 8 hours are passed in sleeping and 2 to 3 hours in preparing ourselves every day. On this, we do not have control over our whole life. \nCreator has decided on human life for almost 100 years. In which half is passed at night and a half out of half in childhood and old age. Currently, you have 25 years to do everything. You have a total of 36,500 days in life. Same time calculate how days you have out of 36,500 days. \n\n> Total days of life= 36,500 days.\n>Total passed days of life.\n(Your age x 365)  ………………\n>Total save days  ……………….\n\nIf you want to do something, be something, get something in life then it is very necessary that first, you will have to learn to make the best use of time so that in a limited time you could possibly achieve all those things that you really wanted to achieve in life. Whether that is money, respect, name, success, or happiness.\n\n\n![chasing-3744753_1280.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/chasing_3744753_1280_cfbf2cb2b2/chasing_3744753_1280_cfbf2cb2b2.jpg)\n\nWe could achieve everything again and again in life excluding time. If we have loosed wealth. We can achieve it again. If we have loosed business. We can stand it again. If we have loosed our property. We can make it again. If we have loosed us any precious thing. We can buy that again, but this principle does not work with time if you lost it once. You can never ever get it again in life. \n\n",

It will always keep on running”.\n\n![pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3760810.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/pexels_andrea_piacquadio_3760810_486f8fd74c/pexels_andrea_piacquadio_3760810_486f8fd74c.jpg)\n\nGenerally, we assume that we know very well. Where our all-time is going but we are 100% wrong because we can only tell you their job time, dinner time, lunchtime, entertainments time, sleeping time, time to get ready for job and family time, etc. but if we will calculate their all-time even then we should have 4 hours safe, but we really don’t know. Where these 4 hours have gone as far as I know about time management. People have a habit of keeping records of time in hours, not in minutes. How much time do they spend on call? we don’t keep a record of it. How much time do we spend on scrolling videos? we don’t keep a record of it. How much time do we spend on smoking and drinking? we don’t keep a record of it. How much time do we waste because of your Laziness? we don’t keep a record of it. Like this, there are many activities in our life. which we don’t love to keep records and never try to improve in life. \n![social-media-5187243_1280.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/social_media_5187243_1280_08dc7eb6f0/social_media_5187243_1280_08dc7eb6f0.png)\n\n### “Who all always use time badly? Those always cry first for this.”\n\nAccording to my experience with time management. The way you make a plan for your finance is the same way you have to generally make a plan for time. In your financial planning make a plan on how do you have to spend and invest money. The same policy has to follow in a matter of time also.\n\nTake one dairy and keep a record of one week. How much time do you take to do any task? From smaller to bigger, from getting up in the morning till going to bed and till right to wrong you do not have to leave any activity. I have experienced that few percent do not want to write their wrong activity. But this mistake you do not have to repeat. If I will have to say it in one word, then I would like to suggest you write a daily routine. \n### “All time management starts with planning.” \n![pexels-polina-kovaleva-5717412.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/pexels_polina_kovaleva_5717412_3b6cb81133/pexels_polina_kovaleva_5717412_3b6cb81133.jpg)\n\n If you could not bring dairy with you then there is another option for it. We generally have a mobile phone. You can keep your record in any software or in a notepad. After one week when you will analysis your one-week record then you will be amazed. Where your free time is wasted with money and energy. How much time you are spending on the internet? How much time you are spending watching T.V? How much time you are spending with friends? How much time you are spending on your laziness? How much time you are spending talking about others and negative or useless things? \n\n### “You could not buy time by anything of this universe.” \n\nGenerally, human is lazy. It could come to your mind. There is no need of keeping a record of time. I can analyze without record, but this way can only find out your mistake but never ever can realize it from inside. By record, you can easily find out. Which task is more important and which is less? Here you have to try to leave less important tasks because you have limited time. Give up something in order to get something. For making your time valuable you need to always try to do important tasks. Which always produces a high result but for this, you need to leave a less important task or you can order to do it someone else. \n\n### “Wasting time means wasting a life”\n",

By this short story and how could you be a better responsible person in your life. \n![pexels-yan-krukov-7640490.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/pexels_yan_krukov_7640490_79bf294da4/pexels_yan_krukov_7640490_79bf294da4.jpg)\n\nOnce there was a small and lovely family. There were only four members in the father and mother and two children. Children were playing together on the balcony. While playing elder brother through a stone at the younger brother and the younger brother moved from there and the glass of the window was broken. The elder brother suddenly went to his mother and told her younger brother had broken the glass of the window then his mother angrily asked to him. How did he break, what he was doing there? Does he have a mind or not. Elder brother describes all story that I through a stone on him and he moved, and the window glass was broken.\n\n Similarly, today people are taking responsibility. They always take responsibility for monitoring not for doing their own self. Responsibility is always taken to accomplish the task. Who always orders everything and thinks that I am so responsible person then here he is wrong? In this short story, there was no mistake in a younger brother. It was my elder brother. If someone has given you some responsibility. and you are ordering someone else he has to accomplish X, Y, Z tasks. In spite of doing own self then after failing you will be really responsible not he. \n\n\n\n",

As a leader, you must have knowledge. Where does it come from? It comes from clarity, ability, and belief in what you really want. As a leader first you must always ask these important questions to yourself\n\n### What they really want\n\n\n\nEveryone wants something in his life. Somebody wants bigger than somebody wants smaller, but everyone wants something. If you know someone who is hopeless and demotivated, and you think that he doesn’t want something in his life. It is not true. He also wants something. The fact is this he could not still meet someone who can motivate, encourage, and lead him to his goal. As a leader, this is your responsibility to find out. what you really want. How will you know it? You will have to find out anyway. \nWhen do you know?  what do you want in life then it brings clarity to life. what do you have to do right now and in the future? This clarity shows the right direction for the future. \n\nWhen you are not clear that what you want in life then you move in the not right direction, on every crossroads of life you will have to ask for the right direction. You will give your 100% but you will be not satisfied. \n\n### Whatever you want. Do you have any plan to achieve it? \n\n\nWhen people want something, but do not see any way to achieve it they get demotivated very easily. Truly it happens without planning what, when, and how do we have to do it? We do not get understand. When I decided to become an influencer then I only knew what do I have to become but how do I have to become? It was completely blank in my mind. After that, I visited amazon and search for some books related to becoming an influencer. I purchased a few books and then read those books for a few days. After reading I knew what I what to become that how do I have to plan.\n\nWhatever you want for achieving that first I will highly recommend you read books on that area and the second source is influencers. You should follow the advice of those people who have been already successful and the third source is a failure. Making a mistake is the sine of learning new thing but this way you do not have to learn everything. What failure and success have already done mistakes you do not have to repeat again otherwise this birth will be not enough for success. you have to learn from those mistakes and move ahead toward your goal.

Every team has a boss but what a team need is a leader. Who can always help them for achieving greatness in life? A boss has the ability to operate a team, but a leader has the ability to take the team to the next level of greatness.\n\nLeader always focuses on teaching and guiding their teams and work with team members for achieving the objectives. Leader monitors their team's progress and makes important adjustments as they need but a boss always only rules their team. He does not manage teams need only orders them for objectives. \n\n![Picture4.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/Picture4_41eca3a8b6/Picture4_41eca3a8b6.png)\n\n#### Today's reader will be tomorrow's leader.\n\nA boss drives the employees but a leader coaches them from time to time on what they need to face a new challenge their way. If any team is not getting the right guidance at the right time, then it is almost sure that that team is going to fail. Every team's success completely depends on leadership. How is the team led by the leader? \nA team is not a robot. Whom you will order every time. As leaders, we need to always love, care for, and inspire them. Behave with them friendly, and don’t let them feel lonely and outsider. \n\n![speakers-414561_1920.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/speakers_414561_1920_1d6a90c651/speakers_414561_1920_1d6a90c651.jpg)\n\nThe biggest quality of a leader, he gives all credit for success to his own team and takes all the credit for failure, but the boss is completely the opposite of it. He takes credit for all success and gives credit for all failure to his team. This quality of boss never inspires the team to give their 100%. A leader uses the word “We” but a boss uses always the word “I “.\n\nA leader always listens more to the need of employees, the idea of employees, the problems of employees, and solutions of employees but a boss always talks more about his ideas, needs, problems, and solutions. Psychologically humans have the nature to love listers, not talkers. If someone is working under your guidance. You are the leader or boss. You must listen. His job doesn’t prove that he is less intelligent than you. The biggest difference between you and him is attitude. Attitude is everything. His attitude has made him an employee and your attitude has made him a leader.\n\nA leader supports, encourage and coach his employee because a leader always takes care of his every employee as a family member. In the family, if any member fails then what does a head of the family member does? He always supports, motivate, encourage their effort, and guide them for the next attempt and say once more again but a boss judges their employee devotion, hard work and effort and never support, inspire, encourage, and coach. A boss behaves with their employees as a stranger.\n\n![man-6107457.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/man_6107457_b2d61b4abe/man_6107457_b2d61b4abe.png)\n\nA leader works with future goals but a boss works with a present goal. This attitude of a leader makes his great personality. If Someone is working in present for the present. It means. He is still back and he is not completely ready for future circumstances Or he does not have any future goals. \nA leader shows “How “it means. He shows the way how is it done. But a boss show “What “it means. Does he command what he wants? Be a leader, not a bass\n\n#### Leader always works with a team \n",

While working for our goal we need to consistently ask deep questions to verify the right path for success but the human ego, fear, doubt, and overconfidence stop us to ask deep questions\n\n![m8.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/m8_6a0f9de4a2/m8_6a0f9de4a2.png)\n\n\n[1] **All of us continue to work every day on specific tasks or multiple tasks for a major goal in life but do we have an idea? Do we live to work or work to live**?  \n\n\n[2] **There are multiple things in life family, money, respect, devotion, name, love, etc but What is one thing you can’t live without**? \n\n\n\n[3] **How do you treat others and want people to treat you**?\n\n\n[4] **Whenever we fix an appointment with someone, we want to make him agree at any rate and our first impression is a lost impression but What impression do you give when you meet a new person**?\n\n\n[5] **About 25 percent of people only live a meaningful life. A meaningful life is one in which you feel engaged, connected to purpose, and able to connect to your passion with your highest value but are you consistently living a meaningful life**?\n![BRDGCF.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/BRDGCF_08bca62b7b/BRDGCF_08bca62b7b.png)\n\n\n\n[6] **There is some force behind each task. If the car is moving, then behind it there is a force. If water is flowing, then behind it there is a force it is always invisible if you have to move in your life for success then what is the force behind you that will always inspire you the most from inside and outside both**?\n![Picture3.pngm.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/Picture3_pngm_82e1a4ceeb/Picture3_pngm_82e1a4ceeb.png)\n\n\n[7] **Most of us have the habit of speaking unthinkably in every place But What is the most important? What do you say or how do you say it**?\n\n[8] **There are some habits in our routine that are completely worrying then what are those habits that always make you most angry even then, you repeat that again and again**. \n\n{9] **Do you believe in true love**?\n\n{10 ]**What makes you the most empowered**? \n\n[11] **There are three things in life. Give up, give in, give it, what would you like to choose out of these? When you are facing challenges or When challenges are out of your control**. \n![Screenshot 2022-09-12 161046.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/monu-bucket/Screenshot_2022_09_12_161046_f822df8513/Screenshot_2022_09_12_161046_f822df8513.jpg)\n\n\n[12] **What is your real source of motivation**?\n\n[13] **Failure always comes before success.

If you are continuously running with productivity issues, then this blog completely helps you to improve your productivity. \n#### Let you addiction for growth be stronger than addiction for the comfort. \n#\n#\n\n\nProductivity begins with action and actions start with the right determination and a positive mental attitude. It all means everything is based on your brain. So first train your brain to improve your productivity. Whether you are a master of self-disciple or struggling to break down a bad habit, addiction affects all of us at some point in our life. However, the addiction we will discuss in this post is not nicotine and caffeine. It's an addiction that becomes more and more prevalent in the human community with each passing year. It's one you may not be aware of: information addiction <br/> <br/>\n\n> **Information addiction is also like other harmful addictions in our life.**\n\nA while back I discussed with various kinds of people enthusiastic learners, bookworms, high-degree receivers, and strugglers who are consistently working to achieve something. I find a widespread similarity in each type of personality that everyone is in the battle of the war. What is happen in war? Each warrior struggles **100%** to defeat the opponents to win the war and save his kingdom.\n#\n\n The same things today's youth is doing. They are consistently receiving the information. They also want to defeat their opponents and win for the sake of a bright future. But here they are doing a big mistake. The data they are consistently receiving. It is not only information but also bad addiction. With the help of the information, you want to fight. It is your real opponent. \n #\n\n\nBecause You have only 24 hours to receive the information, but I think you are still unaware. What is being in the world? here are a few key pieces of data that reveal just how much information we absorb on a daily basis \nEvery minute:\n#\n* Facebook users share nearly 2.5 million pieces of content.\n* Instagram users post nearly 500,000 times.\n* Twitter user tweeted nearly 350,000 times.\n* Amazon generates over $283,000 in online sales.\n* Youtube users upload seventy-two hours of new video content.\n* Apple users download nearly 75,000 apps.\n* Email users send over 200 million messages. \n\n#\n#\nAccording to IBM marketing cloud, 90% of the data in the world today was created in the last two years alone, with 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being created every single day.  You need to think about that for a second.  \nFor every scroll, letter, book, photo, movie, report, tape, CD, mp3, mp4, Youtube video, short video,  painting, and social media post from the beginning of time until now 90% of it was created in the last two years. With new devices, sensors, and technology the data rate will only continue to accelerate.\n\n>[*35 things consistently wasting your time.*](https://monumaurya.com/blogs/35-biggest-time-waster-of-your-life?start=15)\n#\nThe data has been created in last few years. It is almost virous for your brain. It is slowly-slowly making us mentally poor. You have noticed that after operating the social media feel stressed.   and This thing you have to give up.  I accept it after coming 3G, and 4G. People has been aware but so much careless. They are spending their most precious time on today virous (social media). We need to receive useable data. We should always read what we need. Powerful things happen when you start putting in the work to achieve your goal and you become addicted to the prosses and fall in love with the prosses. \n ",

If Every person is doing any type of task in their life. There is one hope behind it and that is growth. It could be here both negative and positive. Growth mindset always goes behind positive things and mixed mindset goes behind negative things but by expecting it is not going to be possible. We know it very well that by expecting, by desiring, and by only our imagination. Nothing happens.\n#### Growth is always uncomfortable for us because We have never been here before\n# \nGrowth mindset always comes from facing uncomfortable zoon and challenges. Growth mindset always focuses on learning new things. It doesn’t matter how much does he know for future challenges. It is eager to take a risk in life. I also believe in more of a leaner than leader and on the other side mixed mindset, it always sticks to what does he know. It doesn’t matter it is wrong or right. This mixed mindset attitude does not let him grow in any field of life. \n#\nGrowth mindset people continually work on their skills and ability to improve it. they do not let it go every easily. they try harder and harder unless it is been 100% successful. Growth mindset people have unique attitude. They never think for comfort zoon because they are very well aware. Comfort zoon is the enemy of their success and they really don’t want to be fail knowingly. If you are aware of your success obstacle and reasons even than you repeats knowingly than by the God blesses you can’t be success and achieve your goal. \n### When things change inside you. things change around you.\n#\nMaking a mistake is sign of new efforts but knowingly is sign of insignificant man. And learner from mistake is sign of significant man.\n\nGrowth mindset people are a great problem solver. This quality makes him unique and different from everyone. On other side mixed mindset people avoid problem and challenges just for their comfort zone and their this habit after some time makes him lazy, complainer, and poor by body and brain both. \n#\nGrowth mindset people are mentally very strong and on other side mixed mindset people are mentally average. They try once every task if that is not able to be they give up soon and not try with new strategy. Growth mindset people after being fail. They do not give up. Use new strategy and make that possible.  \n#### When you procrastinate you also postpone happiness.\n\n",

Stop multitasking- \nThere are three types of people in this world. First who procrastinate always for every works and always try how could I be safe from works. second who always keeps on doing every works in his life. these kinds of people never procrastinate and think about quality of works just keeps on doing. and third who never procrastinate and keeps on doing every works in life. They only do quality of works. which creates high value in their life.\n\nThird quality we have to develop within us. We don't have to be procrastinator and multitasker (Who always do everything.) We have to stop multitasking as soon as it may be possible because you are not a servant who will always keep on doing everything. There are two percent people in this world who can multitask, but problem is 98% rest of the people are thinking that I am in 2%. Actually, it is really poor mindset. the first secret to work smartly stop multitasking start doing those tasks which helps you 70 to 80% to reach to your destination. Take a pen and pepper and write down one side more important task and one side less important task. More important task is acritical task that create the most significant result. less important task is a time eater and create insignificant result and you have to always start your day with more important tasks. \n\nWhen you stop multitasking you become more focused, get more time to try something new, get new opportunity, become less stress and become more productive in life. this is the first ultimate secret to work smartly. \n\nOur brain is life personal computer. When do you open too many tabs in your computer at the same time then how it performs. very slow than before in the same way when you multitask. Your performance become slow than before. Multitasking is a sign of stress and diseased mind and when you focus on only one object you become more productive, stress-free and active\n\n> **I am multitasking. I can listen, ignore, and forget at the same time.** \n\n<br/>\n\n## 2. Create morning routine\nStart your morning with fabulous planning. Planning shows the direction to move toward. project yourself for the day what all you have to do today and how do you have to begin your day? priorities it when your morning will be active and positive then automatically your whole day will be completely active and positive. Morning in an important time of day. how you spend your morning can often tell you what end of the day you will have. Wake up early and shine before the sunshine. Do not sleep with dream live with dream wake up and make it come true. \n\nWake up before the sun rise. Here is billion dolor morning routine. You must develop all these within you.\n\n**> Recall your dream**\n\n**> Make your bed**\n\n**> Drink a glass of water**\n\n**> 10-minute morning meditation**\n\n**> 10-to-20-minute stretch**\n\n**> Brush your teeth and wash your face**\n\n**> Take a one cup of coffee or tea**\n\n**> Take a healthy breakfast to fuel your day**\n\n**> Read article about something you want to read while eating**\n\n**> Review your schedule**\n\n**> Write down your to do list**\n\n**> Get your day started! you got this**\n\n \n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## 3. Manage your surrounding\nBefore beginning the work, you must minimize distraction. It will help you get focus on work. Generally, there are four kinds of distractions. First visual distractions, second manual distractions, third auditory distractions, and forth cognitive distractions. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### What Distracts people at work?\n\n**> Mobile phone**\n\n**> The internet**\n\n**> Gossip** \n\n**> Social media**\n\n**> Smoke break or snack break**\n\n**> Emailing**\n\n**> Meeting**\n\n**> Noisy co-worker**\n\n**> Personal problem and worries**\n\n<br/>\n\n\n\nDistraction directly attacks on our productivity and memory According to a new study made by the researcher from Simon Fraser University.\n\n**> Better memory = Higher ability to avoid distraction** \n\n**> Poorer memory = Lower ability to avoid distraction**\n\n<br/>\n\n#### The benefits of reducing workplace distraction\n\n**> 75% of people say they get more done and are more productive.**\n\n**> 57% of people say they feel motivated to do their best.**\n\n**> 51% of people say they feel more confident about work tasks.**\n\n**> 44% of people say they deliver higher quality of work.**\n\n<br/>\n\n \n Ther are many benefits of avoiding the distractions. These are few of those and few percent people say they are more productive in noisy environment. Manage your surrounding distractions and increase your productivity at work.\n #\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n ## 4. Learn to say no\n\n Do not over schedule yourself and become realistic what you can accomplish in single day. Saying no allows you to choose where you should put your time and energy. Saying no to someone it sounds little bit silly, but the truth is you avoid the distraction. You have already scheduled yourself if you do not learn to say anyone it means your inviting the distraction to decrease your productivity at work. Saying no some can create more mental health stability with self-care and build your self-esteem and confidence by setting boundaries.\n\n<br/>\n\n>[ **Ask deep question to know yourself**](https://monumaurya.com/blogs/deep-life-questions-must-ask-to-yourself)\n\n#\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n ## 5. Take breaks \n Many of us are used to work consistently without taking a break the excuse for not taking a break is a high workload, a deadline, important client, urgent request or urgent project or may be something else. in order to stay sharp and focused it is very important take a break. You can take 5-to-10-minute break, a longer break or you can take break form of short vocation but take a break.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## 6. Track your progress each day\n When you track your progress, you become more purposeful about work you do. We make a to do list or project ourselves every day before beginning the day. In the end of day, it is not guaranteed that every task will be completed. When you track your progress then you find out that what you have to work on and what is really right for now and what do you have to project yourself tomorrow. While tracking progress level when you see something is completed then your brain releases the dopamine it let you feel happy and motivated. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n ## 7. Stop caring what people will say\n If you think about people, then what people will think about you. It is not your duty to think about people. You should always focus on your work. While struggling people will criticize and after success they will admire for your work. They are free to say something before and after both, but you are not free you have a goal.\n\n",

      "content": "# How to become winner in life\nWho is really winner? What does it mean to be a winner? What is winning? Is it any rocket science hard to crack by any common person? Is it like a quantum physics which can not grasp by average student? \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nWinning is something that everyone can easily achieve. It is for everyone. Winning always not considered by extraordinary things or work. It is always considered by desire what you really want to achieve. **While trying if you fail then do not loss yourself.  Accept failure and work on it with determination without blaming yourself. This is the true mindset of a winner.**\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe first and last word of every dreamer(**win**). All of us want to always win in every area of life. We want to be success, financially free, good health, good relation, stress-free lifestyle, good friend, and good job, etc. I can't pinpoint exactly what you really want in life unless you are sacrificing your time and dreams for others. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (1) Be eager to learn everyday something. \nGreat leaders are always a great reader. Learn everyday something it sharp your memory, skill, and ability to solve the problems. Everyday learning empowers us to fight with social virous. All of us know very well about the importance of exercising the body everyday but few of us know about the benefits of exercising the brain. \n>Rather than cramming your brain with a bunch of information all at once, try taking it slow by simply striving to learn something new every day. - **Frank Elaida**\n#\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n ## (2) Set priorities\n Prioritization is always first step to start your day. Work is limitless and time is limited. If you want to complete your work on the time, then you need to immediately priorities your task in order to importance. Prioritization saves your time, energy and open many opportunities in life.  Take one pen and pepper and write down your all tasks. One side you have to write most important tasks and one side you have to write less important tasks and you have to always start your day with most important tasks\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nWhen you start your day by priority or with important tasks then you get high result in less time and in less energy. Which help you 70% to 80% to reach near your destination and in the rest of the time you can try something new. This is real magic of prioritization and when you began to start day without prioritization then you began to do less and most important task both. You began to do without seeing the end result. and less important tasks always waste your time and energy.\n>**Priorities your all tasks to become winner. start your day with only most important tasks and get everything you want in life.** \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#\n## (3) Stay focused \nIn the search of water digging the deep at multiple place some feet better than digging the deep at one place 100 feet for water. Multiple things will come on the way of your goal to distract your focus but with high determination you have to always focus on your goal. \n\nDistraction directly attacks on our productivity and memory According to a new study made by the researcher from Simon Fraser University.\n**> Better memory = Higher ability to avoid distraction** \n**> Poorer memory = Lower ability to avoid distraction**\n\n>**When you stay focused then Your productivity and memory perform on high levels. stay focused always in life.**\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (4) Don't be afraid to fail\nDon't be afraid to fail. Failure is part of success journey. Failure doesn't mean the end of life, instead it's another way and opportunity to start strongly and wisely. You should not be afraid to fail but afraid to fail the same way again and again. after being fail you must learn a lesson form that and never replete that again in life. This is real attitude of winner. If someone say> I have never been failing in my life. It means. He has never tried in life. You should not be afraid to fail but afraid not to trying ever in life. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (5) Don't quit\nChallenges make you more responsible that life without struggle is a life without success. Don't quit and learn not to quit. While trying if you fail then do not give up. Your failure shows you this is not exact way to achieve goal. You need to change your strategy and again you have to consistently try until you do not get that. You want to be a winner and winner never quit and quitter never become winner. Problems come in the way of success. You will have to always short out. Nothing comes in the life easily. You will have to fight for everything.  \n\n>**If you feel life like quitting then think about why you started**\n\n\n",

      "content": "# 5 Things everyone should quit right now\nSuccess is name of quitting and accepting something. In this blog I am going to discuss about 5 things which everyone should quite right now. These 5 things are consistently wasting our time, energy, and distracting focus. You need to know what those things are you must quit.  \n\n<br/>\n<br/> \n\n### (1) Stop Trying to please everyone\nThere is not any way to make everyone please, so it is better to save your time and energy instead of making everyone please. You may be tired, weak, and lazy but people's desire will never finish. they will desire one by one. I have seen most of the people are so busy in trying to please their team, family, society, and friends. Let everyone judge you. Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossips about you. Thier opinions are not your problems. You stay kind and commit to love. No matter what ever they do and say and never be afraid of losing people you love and care. You should be afraid of losing yourself while trying to please everyone.\n\nDon't feel bad about making an important decision that upsets other people. You are not responsible for their happiness you are responsible for your happiness. I have seen various people who complain about one thing you have not done instead of being thankful of thousands of things you have done for them. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (2) Living in the past\nIf you don't leave your past in the past, it will destroy your future. Live for what today has to offer, not what yesterday has taken away. Your past is not going to change at any rate and by living in the past you consistently destroying your present and future both. Come out of past zoon and make plan for your today that what you can do better for future. When your past calls you, don't answer it has nothing new to say. \n\nThere are many disadvantages of living in the past causes' negative vibration\n that not only effect on your mind but also your health. It can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, obesity, and anorexia. You always feel like tired all the time and you are not able to stay productive at work. Come out of your past zoon and live with bright present the only things you can do is to accept it and learn from it and move on for better and brighter life. It's waiting.\n\n\nHave you ever realized that how much time do you have total. I think that nobody knows the exact time how much does he have? Someone has died in 20 years someone 30 years, someone 60 someone before 20 years. It means. There is not any guarantee of life. You should enjoy every moment of life. stop worrying about past think about you present brighter and happier.\n\n>**Life begin when you learn to be happy.**\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (3) Putting yourself down.\nSomehow you need to find out core of you. Who are you from inside? Your values, your beliefs, your power, your desires, your dream once you understand. There is only one you. You are unique. There is not anyone like you. Do not judge yourself by surrounded people thoughts. Once you come out their zone and see, feel, and imagine your real power What you can always do consistently best? Don’t worry about field, scopes, and competitors When you are the best then nothing can stop you.\n\n>**“Most of our decision big or small are made unconsciously and involve emotion.” Hundreds of decisions are made every day.**\n\n>**Hundreds of decisions are made every day, we don’t make every decision through logical way. Even big or small we think we are making logically but research show that Most of our decision big or small are made unconsciously and involve emotion.**\n\n### Know yourself first\nBefore beginning the journey of being extraordinary you need to really know about yourself. It is your first duty. Do not begin this journey by surrounded people appreciations because you know well enough about yourself than others. You know well about your strength, weakness, cause of happiness, stress, anger, excitement, motivation, and ability.  You do not have select your career path by other appreciations or by looking someone life style because by his life style you can only judge his positive angle not negative angle. Negative angle is hard work, learning, demotivation, failure, and stress while doing that. These are negative words but it could be for you while doing that perhaps maybe you could not bear this level hard work, demotivation, failure and stress. And at this situation your strength become weakness and your weakness become a big problem for you.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nWalk away from people who put you down. Walk away from fights that will never be resolve. Walk away from social virous. Walk away negative self-talker. Walk away from society who does not understand your worth. The more you walk away from things that poison your soul the heathier you become in life. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nMake a list of positive things that you love to do and practice it again and again. Do something better for others which brings smile on face. try something new that you had thinked in the past. You will do. Set a goal for brighter future and exercise every day and stay positive and active all the time.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (4) Overthinking \nOverthinking itself is not a mental illness, it is associated with conditions including depression, anxiety, eating disorder and substance use disorders. It is just a painful reminder that you care way too much, even when you shouldn't. In one word I use to say the art of creating problems.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## (5) Fear of change\n Fear of change is also known as metathesiophobia. Those who have metathesiophobia may experience anxiety, depression, fatigue, stress and pain. The fear of change may come from family, childhood experience, personal outlook, current condition, and just the way people are programmed. \n\n\n\n \n\n",

How would you react? Could you hold out for the greater rewards? Do not doubted. It is sure. You will get but if you wait. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThis concept is referred to as \"Instant pleasure\" or Instant gratification and It has been one of the silent killers of many dreams and goal. It has been most terrible habit in our life. We always want to forget the short-term pain, but the biggest problem is instant gratification provide instant pleaser and long-term pain. What do you really want. Do you want short pleasure and long-term pain or short-term pain and long-term pleasure in life. if you want long term pleasure then you will have to completely stop yourself from instant gratification. \n\n<br/>\n\n>**People who grow up without sense of how today has affected by yesterday are unlikely to have strong sense of how today can affect tomorrow**- Lynne Cheney\n\nDo not allow yourself and other for instant gratification because this is not right way to use your higher potential. Eighty seven percent people spend more than one third of their life with no passion and seventy six percent people now are activity disengaged and I don't like what they do. \n\n<br/>\n\nInstant gratification can often lead to procrastinate. I consider it a form of self-sabotage and people who caught up in the instant pleasure trap often expect result. they invest meager effort blowing thousands of dollars in the process, then get frustrated when they don't see result. I am here to tell you it simply doesn't work that way. Too much instant gratification can cause long-term dissatisfaction. Most of us don't be the part of process, they just want to be the part of outcome, but the process is where you figure out your real worth. \n\n<br/>\n\n### Consider it once for better life.\n\n<br/>\n\n**If you delay the gratification of skipping or sleeping in and go for a run instead, you will become stronger and more energetic.** \n\n**If you delay the gratification of watching Netflix after a long day at your 9-to-5 and work on your side business, you will be able to quit you job sooner.**\n\n**If you delay the gratification buying junk food at the store and you will eat healthier food when you come at home then you feel better and you can also save your money.** \n\n**If you delay the gratification of going out and parting until you have earned it, you will avoid the stress of unfinished work.** \n\n**If you delay the gratification of buying nice things until you have the money, you will appreciate your purchases more, knowing you genuinely earned them.** ",
